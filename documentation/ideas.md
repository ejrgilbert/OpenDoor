If push notifications on, you can add certain friends as "best friends" and when their doors are open they are notified somehow.

When leave, notify if they want to close their door (through Google Maps "my current location")

How to set your location

Have subgroups within your friends list

Set events in the future to plan ahead

Implement a way to invite friends to the app/have options easily available to add people as friends

Authorization outside of existing social Media
- use email, etc.
- Django allows for sign in of multiple SMN's

Password reset functionality

If user forgets to close door (maybe check via GPS), send notification
