# OpenDoor Business Plan
---

## Customer Segments ##
*Who is your target audience?*

### Target Demographics ###
- Age: 18 to 30
- Gender: Non-specific
- Occupation: Mainly students (but not limited to them)
- Marital Status: Single
- Geographic Location: Non-specific
- Household income: $0 to $30,000

*Note:* Above demographics seek to define our largest user target audience rather than it being exhaustive.

### Psychographics ###
- People who want to meet up with friends without the hassle of planning.
- Individuals who have free time, but don't know when they will be free.

---

## Problem ##
- Friends socializing without you
- Planning is _annoying_ (changing plans, fall through)
- Group messages... (lost information)

## Solution ##
- Create an app that eliminates planning
  - Based on spontaneity
  - Via remote, unsaid invitations
    - Containing location and activity description
- Manageable friends list
  - Can add or remove individuals
  - Only friends can see when your door is open/closed
    - Ensures privacy

Current solutions:

- *NONE*
- Currently, you have to plan via "FB Events"
- Nothing where you can _avoid_ planning

---

## Liability / Terms of Service ##

Need to outline specific policies
- possibly interactive terms of use
Possibly discuss with legal counselor
Participants must sign terms of service and any changes to those must be signed again

Keep logs of interactions
Implement a report system
- Or at least create our base MVP in a way this would be easy to add on
- Can be as simple as an email account

---

## Targeting Our Solution ##

- College students during the semester
- Students over the summer

- List of events going on now/will be happening
  - Today, this week, this month
- *Mobile Ad-networks* already exist

Sponsorship

- Business on app all the time
   - Maybe discount for OpenDoor users
- Possible scrolling ads at the top (preferably not though)
- Once gets larger, show to key sponsors (Target, etc.)

In-app upgrade

- Upgrade to version without ads

Possible data-mining?
- Check source
- What kind of information?
- Gives context to a location (aka. studying at a coffee shop)

  - AWS
  - Google Maps API calls

## Key Metrics ##

Our [metrics](http://www.buzinga.com.au/buzz/infographic-how-to-measure-the-success-of-your-app/):

- Acquisition Metrics
  - Which channel brings most downloads?
  - Geographically where is user downloading from?
- Retention Metrics
  - How many users consistently use our app?
  - What is the rate of customers stopping use?
- Behavior Metrics
  - Which devices are used?
  - Where are users when they use the app?
  - Frequency of use
  - When did the users use the app?
  - Which screens do users engage with the most?

Frameworks in mobile space for logging/mining Metrics
- need to timestamp the logs
- for behavior and Retention

Figure out which demographics make up our user base to better target advertising

Won't need to build, depend on existing frameworks for this

  - [_Branding_](http://www.buzinga.com.au/buzz/10-steps-to-branding-your-app/)
